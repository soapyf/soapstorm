**[Firestorm](https://www.firestormviewer.org) is a free client for 3D virtual worlds such as Second Life and various OpenSim worlds where users can create, connect and chat with others from around the world.**

## About This Fork

**This is a modified fork of the Firestorm viewer that I am using to mess with ideas and learning. If you've arrived here in search of the offical firestorm viewer you can find it at [official website](https://www.firestormviewer.org/choose-your-platform/)**

### What's Changed

- Users can now click "Forget" to leave privileged experiences
- Users can block privileged experiences if desired
- The "Privileged" label still displays for transparency
- Only 2 conditional checks removed in `llfloaterexperienceprofile.cpp`

This demonstrates that the restriction is purely client-side UI logic and can be removed to respect user autonomy.
